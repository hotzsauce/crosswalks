# crosswalks

Various crosswalks I've found convenient to store. Mostly concerning BEA underlying tables & my personal project, `edan`, and BEA-FRED correspondences.

### edan-bea\_underlying\_pce.json

Stores the underlying PCE series codes in BEA tables `2.4.3U`, `2.4.4U`, `2.4.5U`, `2.4.6U`, corresponding to quantity index, price index, nominal consumption, and real consumption series, respectively. Those table names and series codes are mapped to the unique codes used in the `edan` library, and other nice-to-have data (full name, table row, etc.) are stored.
